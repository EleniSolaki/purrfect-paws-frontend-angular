# Purrfect Paws Frontend - Angular

This project is an Angular-based frontend application, part of a 10-day full-stack application build challenge. You can find the backend [here](https://github.com/EleniSolaki/purrfect-paws-backend-spring). It utilizes the Angular framework to create a dynamic and responsive web application for a cat adoption app. The user can sign up, login and browse among different cats to be adopted. The user can add cats to favourites and start an inquiry for adoption. After successful submission of the form, the user receives a confirmation email. The user can then logout from the app. In the footer of the app, the user can find the company's email, phone, a form to submit a direct message, as well as links for social media.
